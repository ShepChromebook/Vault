    Hair Management and Removal Tips/Tricks
    
    Controlling Hair on the Body and Face:
    
    When making decisions about hair reduction and removal, it can be difficult to decide what options are best. This is a short document designed to help you navigate what hair removal processes look right for you. This document is not designed to replace research and consultation with medical providers and aestheticians who might be providing these services.
    
    Body Hair
    
    Human beings of all genders have body and facial hair. The amount of hair present on the body is often determined by several factors, including hormones, genetic history, and other medical factors. Though gender dysphoria caused by hair can be distressing, body hair does not invalidate your gender. That said, there are ways to manage hair that you might utilize to feel more comfortable in your body.  Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT) may cause changes in hair growth on the body over a long period of time. Facial hair activated by testosterone in the body may be more resistant to such changes. In the meantime, there are several options to manage hair. 
    
    Shaving and other Non-Permanent Methods 
    
    Many people use shaving as a means to control body and facial hair. Depending on the hair and growth present, this may be effective for most of a day or for multiple days. It is important to use tools that balance hair reduction and safety and minimize irritation to the skin. Shaving also blunts the end of a hair follicle, which can feel like hair is getting thicker or growing back faster. This is not true. Hair with a blunt end simply feels different than unshaven hair with a soft, tapered tip. Shaving is a very useful tool as it can be done at home or even on the go. Other tools also exist to manage hair on the body. It can be helpful to try multiple options to find one that fits in with your schedule, body, and needs.  
       
    Disposable razors are often used for close shaving of the face and body. These are best utilized when wet with shaving cream, gel, or other ways to moisturize and protect the skin afterwards to prevent irritation. Some products may have other features that might improve comfort and effectiveness, though these razors are disposable and will dull with time and become less effective with time. These can be purchased at most pharmacies, grocery stores, or online. Shaving dry or without ways to soothe the skin can cause razor burn, which is an uncomfortable irritation of the skin that can also be visible. As these use sharp blades, accidentally cutting the skin can also be possible, especially in delicate areas. It is important to assess the quality, safety, and proper use of these devices before using them.   
    Electric razors can be very helpful in managing body and facial hair. These devices use disposable razor heads that clip onto a body with an electric motor. These can come in different sizes, contain different features and are offered at different price points. It can be helpful to purchase one that is waterproof for use in the shower. If you plan on regularly clearing body and facial hair, an electric razor can be a powerful tool. Though it often does not shave as closely as a disposable razor, it can be utilized with less skin irritation, less chance for cutting the skin and cover larger portions of the body quicker. There are even some razors designed to be kept in a small bag or purse to use to touch up areas while on the go and can be useful if dysphoria is causing problems away from home. It is important to assess the quality and safety of these devices when choosing between them, and to follow instructions and heed safety labels when using them.   
    Tweezers are used to remove hairs, often eyebrow hairs, to groom parts of the body by plucking the hair from the follicle. This can come with varying levels of comfort and effectiveness. It is important if you are pursuing something like electrolysis to consult with your aesthetician about whether plucking is preventing you from effectively treating your hairs. 
    
    Epilators are devices used to mechanically pluck hairs from the body. These can come in various sizes and powers and should be used carefully, as misuse could become painful. It is important to follow the instructions included with such devices. It is important to consider comfort and efficiency with grooming so that you can use a method that can be a comfortable part of your regular grooming routine. 
    
    Waxing involves the use of a sticky material to pull hair from the follicle over an area of your body. This can be done by a professional or at home using various methods and products, with varying levels of comfort. As this often involves heated material, it is important to follow instructions and be cautious of unsafe products. The use of a professional aesthetician can help ensure a greater degree of comfort and safety, and it is important to educate yourself regarding various methods and materials. The advantages of waxing involve the removal of most of the hair itself from the body, at least until the follicle produces a new hair. Regular waxing can reduce the need for regular shaving in some cases when done correctly and safely. 
    
    Hair cream involves the use of a chemical agent to dissolve the hair off the body. Though sometimes effective, this method carries the risk of damaging the skin if used improperly. It is important to use good judgement when selecting products and follow instructions carefully. Most products might not be suitable for certain areas of the body, such as the genitals or face.  
    
    Shaving can be a challenge. Here are dermatologists’ tips to help you get a clean shave from the American Academy of Dermatology Association (aad.org):
    
    1. Before you shave, wet your skin and hair to soften it. A great time to shave is right after a shower, as your skin will be warm and moist and free of excess oil and dead skin cells that can clog up your razor blade.
        
    2. Next, apply a shaving cream or gel. If you have very dry or sensitive skin, look for a shaving cream that says “sensitive skin” on the label.
        
    3. Shave in the direction that the hair grows. This is an important step to help prevent razor bumps and burns.
        
    4. Rinse after each swipe of the razor. In addition, make sure you change your blade or throw away disposable razors after 5 to 7 shaves to minimize irritation.
        
    5. Store your razor in a dry area. Between shaves, make sure your razor dries completely to prevent bacteria from growing on it. Do not leave your razor in the shower or on a wet sink.
        
    6. People who have acne should take special care while shaving. Shaving can irritate your skin, making acne worse.
        
        1. If you have acne on your face, try experimenting with electric or disposable blade razors to see which work best for you.
            
        2. Use a razor with a sharp blade.
            
        3. Shave lightly to prevent nicks and never try to shave off the acne as both can make acne worse.
            
    
    Here is a link to a website that has a little more information about the specifics of shaving for specific parts of the body. As a note, some of the language on this website is gendered and we want to acknowledge that not everyone identifies with the words that are used on this page or use those words to describe parts of their own bodies. It does have some information that may be helpful to learn more about strategies for shaving: [Shave as New | How To Trans](https://howtotrans.com/2016/12/04/shaving/)
    
    Permanent and Semi-Permanent Methods
    
    Some methods exist for permanent hair removal or reduction and involve more elaborate methods, and almost always involve treatment in a professional setting at higher cost. It is important to spend time talking to providers and doing research to find the methods that are right for you, your budget, and your goals. When talking to providers it is important to select ethical, trustworthy, and skilled technicians for the best results and who use methods that are consistent with the science behind them. When seeking treatment in preparation for surgery, it is even more important to follow the recommendations of the surgeons and your hair removal specialists. 
    
    Laser Hair Removal is a method of hair reduction. This method involves using targeted lasers to affect the hair follicle responsible for growing and regrowing hair across the body and face, reducing their ability to grow hair over time. This method can prevent or reduce the growth of hair in a treated part of the body but does not guarantee its removal.   
       
    Laser works best with those who have dark hair. People with very light, blonde, gray, or red hair do not benefit from laser hair removal. It may be important to talk to an ethical provider to assess if your hair is dark enough for treatment. Different parts of the body might have different colored hair that can affect the effectiveness of laser treatment. Laser hair removal has some major advantages over the other major method of hair removal, electrolysis. Laser can treat large portions of the body faster and with less pain and discomfort than electrolysis. For parts of the body like the arms, legs, and chest, laser can be an effective way to reduce the overall volume and growth of hair for suitable candidates. People can stay close-shaven for laser, while electrolysis needs a certain amount of space from shaving for technicians to be effective. 
    
    It is important to follow the instructions and safety briefings of any provider performing laser hair removal to avoid damage, discomfort, or other concerns. Laser hair removal might not be for everyone. Laser can have varying degrees of pain and discomfort, depending on the method and person. 
    
    Some products are sold that promise the ability to perform laser hair removal at home. Be cautious around the promises of such products and be mindful that some may not be safe to use. When in doubt, consult a certified provider of laser hair removal with a good reputation to set realistic expectations. Many places will offer consultations for free to help you decide if it is right for you.
    
    Laser hair removal has some disadvantages. Laser is not often covered by medical insurance and is not a perfect replacement for the hair removal required for certain surgeries. Laser may not be a permanent solution and time, hormone changes, or other factors may cause regrowth of hair as far as years into the future. Laser also cannot be used at the same time as electrolysis, which may affect the choices some people make. It is important to understand that laser does not always destroy or remove the hair follicle, it reduces its ability to regrow hair. This is why it is used for hair reduction and not hair removal. 
    
    Electrolysis is the only FDA approved method of permanent hair removal. It involves the use of a sterile probe inserted into the pore of the skin to destroy the structure responsible for hair growth. Each hair may need several treatments in order to be effective and must take place over a period of time so that dormant hairs can be identified and treated. This process is performed by a trained technician, most often in a clinic or spa setting. 
    
    Discomfort involved in electrolysis can vary depending on the location on the body, as well as the person. Some topical numbing can be used, but discomfort and swelling is common. It is important to discuss the science, risks, benefits, and effects of electrolysis and to follow the instructions of providers trained in its use. Electrolysis can sometimes be billed or reimbursed through medical insurance. It is important to discuss options with your medical provider, medical insurance, and electrolysis technician if this is possible. Depending on several factors, a full area can take over a year to complete, so planning is essential. It is possible to begin electrolysis before settling on your choice of surgeon, so talk to your medical providers and insurance about your options when considering surgery.
