Top 50k scorers: 34k will be commended, 16k will be semifinalists.

# Semifinalists
More than 16,000 of the high scorers, representing less than 1% of the nation’s high school graduating
seniors, will qualify as Semifinalists.

# To qualify as a Finalist, a Semifinalist must:
1. continue to meet all program entry requirements (explained in Entry Requirements on
page 33);
2. be enrolled in the last year of high school and planning to enroll full-time in college
the following fall, or be enrolled in the first year of college if grades 9 through 12 were
completed in three years or less;
3. be fully endorsed for Finalist standing and recommended for a National Merit Scholarship
by the high school principal;
4. have a record of consistently very high academic performance in all of grades 9 through
12 and in any college course work taken (the high school must provide a complete record
of courses taken and grades earned by the student, as well as information about the
school’s curriculum and grading system);
5. complete the National Merit Scholarship Application with all information requested,
which includes writing an essay;
6. take the SAT® or ACT and earn scores that confirm the PSAT/NMSQT performance that
resulted in Semifinalist standing; and
7. provide any other documentation and information that NMSC requests

# Choosing Scholarship Winners
Approximately half of the Finalists will be Merit Scholarship winners (Merit Scholar awardees).
Winners are chosen on the basis of their abilities, skills, and accomplishments—without regard to gender, race,
ethnic origin, or religious preference. Scholarship recipients are the candidates judged to have the greatest
potential for success in rigorous college studies and beyond.
To receive a scholarship payment, a Merit Scholarship winner must notify NMSC of plans to
(a) enroll in a college or university in the United States that holds accredited status with a regional
accrediting commission on higher education, and (b) enroll full-time in an undergraduate course of
study leading to a traditional baccalaureate degree. NMSC scholarship stipends are not payable for
attendance at service academies or certain institutions that are limited in their purposes or training.
The selection process involves evaluating substantial amounts of information about Finalists
obtained from both students and their high schools. Included are the Finalist’s academic record (course
load and difficulty level, depth and breadth of subjects studied, and grades earned); PSAT/NMSQT
scores; the student’s essay; demonstrated leadership and contributions to school and community
activities; and the school official’s written recommendation and characterization of the Finalist.
The same process is used to select Special Scholarship winners for a corporate sponsor’s awards
