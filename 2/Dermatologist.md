- Do you recommend popping acne
- [x] Hydrocolloid patches? (probs not)
- Clay mask?
- How much should i worry about applying SPF sunscreen @ morning+midday and wearing UPF clothes. My school has lots and lots of windows and natural sunlight, and so does my house.
- How often should I exfoliate
- How should I take care of the insane acne on my back
  *(that appears to be dry on the top and moist on the bottom)*
- Retinol appears to be primarily for wrinkles & fine lines, would it be helpful?
- I was previously prescribed a certain Benzoyl peroxide topical mix (it probably had adapalene mixed in?)
- I have whiteheads all around my face, blackheads on my nose, and I've had painful inflammatory acne too

- Accutane / Isotretinoin?
