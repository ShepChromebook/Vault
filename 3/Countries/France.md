## Eiffel Tower

## H
Where art from the Louvre was stored during ww2 to keep it safe from the nazis.
## Versailles
Bring a car/golf cart, it's massive, and it's MID. Also rain was bad.
## Konbini
Onigiri overpriced and definitely far from as good as Japan, but might still be a little worth if hungry in the morning. Potato chips are cheaper.
