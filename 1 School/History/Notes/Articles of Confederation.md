# Articles of Confederation
> The Congress of the Confederation
- Had very few powers.
- It mainly provided legitimacy to the Continental Congress for directing the Continental army, conducting diplomacy with Europe, printing money, and dealing with territorial issues.
- It did not have any executive power, and it could not regulate interstate or foreign commerce.

> Confederation: Cooperative treaty between a group of states that does not seek to unite them into a single country. The only modern example of a confederation is the European Union.
Confederacy: Shared sovereignty: States hold power, confederacy is only as powerful as states decide.  All about state independence! Didnt want a central power to boss them around!

_Constituent democracy: Representative democracy._ Federalism: National government supreme

**Economics:** No ability to enforce ==taxes==. Of requested, only a fourth were paid. ==Not enough members==, no pay.
States made own laws on ==trade==, taxes, & tariffs. Challenging.
==Inflation== of continental currency. They printed too many continentals (bc they didnt have enough to pay soldiers). States made their own currency. Difficult to do business out of state.

**International Diplomacy** TK i think they technically did well initially, but lost credit later?

**Passing Laws and Amendments** ==No judicial branch. No executive branch==/president.

**Raising an Army:** No taxes, can't pay em

**Federal courts dont exist.**

**Overall problem:** ==states more powerful than the national government==.
