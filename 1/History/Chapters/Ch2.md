1. Explain how the Spanish used the resources and people of Mexico and the Andes to enrich the Spanish
Empire, include terms like hacienda and encomiendas in your explanation.
- The Spanish system used the resources of the native peoples & empires of Mexico to enrich the Spanish Empire. Conquistadors received encomiendas from the crown which allowed them to claim labor & goods tributes from the Indians. Spaniards also moved out from cities into the countryside, creating large estates known as haciendas that facilitated regional networks of markets.

2. Explain why the Jamestown settlement struggled so much in the early years, feel free to include
thoughts in addition to what the text provides.
1600s! (1607)
The Jamestown settlement had several personal issues, including:
- Jamestown is located in a swamp; resulting in fatal dysentery & malaria outbreaks.
- Many were “gentleman” unaccustomed to labor, or gold-seeking adventurers.
- Key source of goods was from Natives, but conflict led to settlers going hungry.
- Starvation.
* Insufficient food reserves (due to ppl originally only coming for quick gold)
* New diseases settlers had no immunity to
* High mortality rates (result of the previous three)
* Unending need for more labor (with the eventual goal of turning a profit)

3. How did John Rolfe help change the original economic goal of the Virginia Company? Describe this
change. Then explain how it was economically better for England and how it affected colonial
relations with Native Americans.
- John Rolfe developed a new variety of tobacco that became a popular & profitable cash crop, changing the specific goal from getting profit by finding gold, to gaining profit through plantations.
- This led to a much longer and more profitable source of income for England than gold-seeking adventurers, but the labor and land needed to create the plantations gave rise to the conditions of indentured servitude that led to Bacon’s Rebellion.

4. Maryland was established as a Proprietary Colony – based on how the book explains it was
established how do you think it was different from a Royal Colony.
- Due to no longer directly serving the king, the Maryland colony could have less loyalty to the English/Anglican church, and more non-English christian branches like Catholicism and the Protestant sects. It also may have had more leeway in terms of self governance.


5. The Virginia Company granted land to settlers who could pay their own passage, plus additional
land to the settler for each person he brought with him. This is known as the Headright System. What are 3 possible social consequences of this system.
- Instead of paying for land, investors could sponsor immigrants. By getting settlers & land owners to pay for transportation of new members, the Virginia Company could bring new labor and increase population in Virginia for minimal cost.
- However, those who were already there could use the headright system to gain more and more of the coastal/good land, while new settlers would have to fight at the frontiers/interior for worse land.
- Many immigrants who started as indentured servants could become landowners, however disparity between newer & older settlers would eventually lead to Bacon’s rebellion.


6. Identify the major motivations for both owners and servants for entering into indentured contracts. Based on the reality of life for the indentured, what inferences can be made about England at the time.
**Owners**: needed more labor for their plantations/farms.
**Servants**: were looking for better opportunities
- Indentured servants worked harsh conditions, with high mortality rates, and would attempt escapes or write to their family to pity them. Regardless of how much or little the indentured servants knew of what the colony conditions would be like, the fact that thousands of servants were willing to go overseas and work under a contract for an average of 7 years showed that prospects in England were not great.

7. Explain 3 reasons why the Dutch lost control of New Netherland after just 50 years.
- The Dutch had no respect for, and seized land and trade from their Algonquian neighbors. In turn, the Algonquian peoples went to war with New Netherland and crippled the colony.
- After the crippling war, the West India trading company ignored New Netherland and focused on more promising ventures. (African slaves & Brazilian sugar)
- The New Amsterdam Governor ruled dictatorially, rejecting demands of representative government, and alienated the colony’s diverse population of Dutch, English, and Swedish residents.
- In turn, the residents put up little resistance when the English invaded the colony.


8. Explain how the banishments of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were related to the Puritan
ideal of a “City upon a hill.” What would be the likely effect of those banishments on the people
that stayed in the Massachusetts Bay colony.
- Roger Williams & Anne Hutchinson were banished from Massachusetts Bay due to dissenting religious views and challenges to the Puritan authority. William advocated for religious freedom and, essentially, the separation of church and state; while Hutchinson disagreed with fundamental beliefs of the church (instead following antinomianism) among other conflicts.
	Their banishment reflects the Puritan ideal of creating a “City upon a Hill” --- a religiously pure and model city that would serve as an example for everyone else. Dissenters were threats to this ideal, as they challenged unity and conformity.
	The effect of those banishments likely reinforced religious conformity and strict adherence to Puritan norms among those who stayed.

9. Explain how land in New England worked to create a measure of political equality, while
maintaining social and economic inequality.
- The Headright system. and the contracts for indentured servants, gave servants the possibility to become landowners. This allowed for some social mobility, where servants could move up to the landowner class and gain freedom, and the right to vote.
However, it still strictly enforced social classes between those with land, and those without, and the landowners who didn’t want their labor to gain their freedom could abuse the system to give the servants more years, intentionally allow the servant to die, or other methods to maintain their power.


10. The Pequot War and Metacom’s (King Philip’s) War helped push out the Native American presence
in New England. Explain how the Puritans used religion to help justify these conflicts.
- Puritans saw themselves as a divine project and the natives as obstacles to their goal of establishing a pure or godly society. The Puritans used their ideals of purity and conformity as a basis for rejecting the native americans, dehumanizing them, and making their displacement a necessary step for Puritan advancement.
**accurate but it does not include any of the textbook commentary about disease and predestination - that should be in the response.**

11. Explain how land, voting, hostility towards Native Americans, and taxes served as causes of Bacon’s
Rebellion. How did the rebellion change the Virginia Colony.
- When newer settlers were given land, it was located in the infertile frontier, where the settlers would need to clear the land, struggle to grow anything, and also fight native americans whose land they were encroaching on.
	These impoverished western farmers wanted the colony’s help in fighting and attacking the Native Americans, and they also believed the taxes on them were heavier than the taxes on the richer planters. (Gov. of Virginia:) Berkeley’s government, however, neither lowered taxes nor wanted to fight the natives, and also did not want to give the western farmers any more representation in government.
	Nathaniel Bacon led the western farmers into an army that raided native villages and, after Berkeley’s government accused Bacon of rebelling against royal authority, Bacon’s army defeated the governor’s forces and burned the Jamestown settlement.
	Bacon’s Rebellion changed the colony temporarily, by forcing the Berkeley government made some appeasements to the western farmers by partially hearing their grievances on taxes, land, and representation.


12. Looking back on the chapter, identify 4 major differences (at least 1 political, 1 social, 1 economic)
between the Chesapeake (Virginia and Maryland) and New England (Mass., Conn., RI) colonies. Looking ahead, how will those differences likely impact the two regions in their relations with “mother” England?
**last part of the question on relations with England?**
- Political: In the Chesapeake colonies, governance was controlled by wealthy landowners with limited representative/democracy. By contrast, New England colonies (massachusetts, connecticut, rhode island) had more representative/participatory governments.
- Social: Chesapeake society was hierarchical, with a clear division between wealthy landowners and indentured servants. New England had less reliance on class differences between landowners and indentured servants for labor, although they still had religious conformity and class distinctions.
- Economic: Chesapeake economy was based on cash crops (tobacco) which required large plantations and an unending need for labor. New England’s economy was more diverse, and less dependent on plantations.
- Political: The Chesapeake colonies also had a distinction between newer and older landowners, specifically the quality of the land they owned. Poorer farmers on the west frontier were divided from those on the coast, and these differences led to Bacon’s rebellion.
