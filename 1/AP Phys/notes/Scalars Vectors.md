# Scalars (+)
You CANNOT travel negative distance.
- distance (m)
- speed (m/s)
	- `v: (s) speed`
- mass (kg)
- time (s)

- energy (J)
- temperature (C)
- density (kg/m^3)
# Vectors ($\pm$)
Direction, and magnitude!
- force
- velocity
	- $\vec{v}$: `velocity, (m/s)` 
- $\Delta{x}$: displacement
- acceleration

> [!note] v OR $\vec{v}$: can represent average velocity

Velocity (v): $\vec{v}_{av} = Δx/Δt$
- vector

Speed (or rate) (r): $r = d/Δt$
- scalar
